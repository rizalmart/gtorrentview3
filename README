FAQ:
====

Q1: I get the following message: configure: error: XML::Parser perl module is 
required for intltool. What do I do about it?

A: You need to make sure that you have the right variant of the xml-parser-pm
package to match the Perl version for your system. Try running 

perl -MCPAN -e shell 

as root and in the cpan prompt type

install XML::Parser.
